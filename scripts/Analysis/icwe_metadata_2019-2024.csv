Such comments well reflect user interests in the frame level, which can be utilized to further improve the accuracy of video recommendation. In this paper, we make the first attempt in this direction and propose a new video recommendation algorithm called SACF by exploiting temporal relationship between time-sync comments and video frames. Our algorithm can extract a rich set of semantic features from crowdsourced time-sync comments, and combine latent semantic representations of users and videos by neural collaborative filtering. We conduct extensive experiments using real TSC datasets, and our results show that our proposed algorithm can improve the recommendation performance by 9.73% in HR@10 and 5.72% in NDCG@10 compared with other baseline solutions.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2019,171-186,16,4,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19274-7_13

These methods split a stream of posts related to an event into several groups along time, and represent each group using unsupervised methods such as paragraph vector. However, many posts in a group (e.g., retweeted posts) do not contribute much to rumor detection, which deteriorates the performance of rumor detection based on unsupervised group embedding. In this paper, we propose a Supervised Group Embedding based Rumor Detection (SGERD) model that considers both textual and temporal information. Particularly, SGERD exploits post-level textual information to generate group embeddings, and is able to identify salient posts for further analysis.

Our new approach builds on two state of the art algorithms. The first algorithm is based on identifying bursty keywords inside blocks of blog messages. The second one involves clustering blog messages based on similarity of their contents. To combine the computational simplicity of the keyword-based algorithm with the semantic accuracy of the clustering-based algorithm, we propose a new hybrid algorithm. We then implement these algorithms in a streaming manner, on top of Apache Storm augmented with Apache Cassandra for state management.

We manually review a dataset of 60 Twitter bot code repositories on GitHub, derive a set of potentially abusive actions, characterize them using a taxonomy of abstract code patterns, and assess the potential abusiveness of the patterns.

However, methods and features for classifying generic attributes do not perform well for more specific attributes, such as whether a user is a mother of a young baby.

The model is not composed of a solid letter model, but a number of spheres to resist character segmentation attacks, and this is why DotCHA is classified as a scatter-type CAPTCHA.

In this paper, a novel data service generation approach for cross-origin datasets is proposed. An attribute dependency graph (ADG) is constructed by using inherent data dependency. Based on the ADG, an automatic data service extraction algorithm is implemented. The extracted atomic data services are further organized into another representation named data service dependency graph (DSDG). Then, a data service encapsulation framework, which includes an entity layer, a data access object layer and a service layer, is designed. Via a flexible RESTful service template, this framework can automatically encapsulate the extracted data services into the RESTful services which can be accessed by the exposed interfaces.

However, there is currently a gap in existing literature regarding the use of visual labels contained in street-level imagery, where their value as indicators of POI categories is assessed.

Catch & Release: An Approach to Debugging Distributed Full-Stack JavaScript Applications,Kijin An & Eli Tilevich,"Software Innovations Lab, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA",Full-stack JavaScript applications; Distributed computing; Debugging,"Localizing bugs in distributed applications is complicated by the potential presence of server/middleware misconfigurations and intermittent network connectivity. In this paper, we present a novel approach to localizing bugs in distributed web applications, targeting the important domain of full-stack JavaScript applications. The debugged application is first automatically refactored to create its semantically equivalent centralized version by gluing together the application’s client and server parts, thus separating the programmer-written code from configuration/environmental issues as suspected bug causes. The centralized version is then debugged to fix various bugs. Finally, based on the bug fixing changes of the centralized version, a patch is automatically generated to fix the original application source files. We show how our approach can be used to catch bugs that include performance bottlenecks and memory leaks. These results indicate that our debugging approach can facilitate the challenges of localizing and fixing bugs in web applications.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2019,459-473,15,12,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19274-7_32

The growth of knowledge bases both with respect to their number and size demands the development of time-efficient and accurate approaches for the computation of such links. This is generally done with the aid of machine learning approaches, such as e.g. Decision Trees. While Decision Trees are known to be fast, they are generally outperformed in the link discovery task by the state-of-the-art in terms of quality, i.e. F-measure. In this work, we present Dragon, a fast decision-tree-based approach that is both efficient and accurate. Our approach was evaluated by comparing it with state-of-the-art link discovery approaches as well as the common decision-tree-learning approach J48. Our results suggest that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with respect to its F-measure while being 18 times faster on average than existing algorithms for link discovery on RDF knowledge bases.

Distributed Intelligent Client-Centric Personalisation,Rebekah Storan Clarke & Vincent Wade,"Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Client side personalisation; Privacy; Prefetching; Click prediction; Interaction modelling,"Personalisation is used extensively to improve user engagement, to optimise user experience and to enhance marketing and advertising online. While privacy has always been an issue in personalised websites, only recently have we seen a noticeable change in consumer’s behaviour’s. User’s are seeing breaches of the personal information harvested, stored and shared by content providers and increasingly adjusting privacy controls, thus negatively impacting the effectiveness of personalisation services. Client-Side personalisation (CSP) approaches offer a privacy-conscious solution, keeping the user data and user model on the client’s own device, allowing users to enjoy personalised content without compromising the privacy of their personal data. However, these solutions have significant problems with scalability and performance due to client-device resource limitations. With an ever-increasing demand for rich multimedia, particularly on more lightweight mobile devices, performance is critical to provide a seamless user experience. This research proposes a hybrid approach which we term Intelligent Client-Centric Personalisation (ICCP), this minimises the leakage of user data while enhancing performance through predictive webpage prefetching. This paper performs a comparative framework evaluation, comparing the ICCP framework performance with a typical client-server personalisation approach. It uses a large dataset of user interactions across three contrasting consumer websites, following case study based methodology. Evaluation shows that such a framework can realise the performance benefits of a client-server approach but with enhanced privacy and reduced personal data leakage.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2019,498-505,8,3,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19274-7_35

A common issue in current crime prediction methods is that, given fine-grained spatial temporal units, crime data would become very sparse, and prediction would not work properly. By modeling crime prediction as a recommendation problem, however, we can make use of the abundant selection of methods in recommendation systems that inherently consider data sparsity. We present our model and show how collaborative filtering and contextual-based recommendation methods can be applied.

Until now, trust is a factor for starting communications and ignores doubts about the content or context of ongoing communications. Several approaches are used to identify whom to trust and how human trust can be computationally modeled. Yet, they do not consider a change of context or of other agents’ behavior at runtime. The proposed doctoral work aims to support content- and context-related trust in open multi-agent systems using linked data. Existing trust models need to be surveyed with respect to content- and context-related trust. A framework based on a fitting trust model and working with linked data must be developed to establish and dynamically refine trust relationships on the autonomous agents’ point of view.

Facilitating the Evolutionary Modifications in Distributed Apps via Automated Refactoring,Kijin An,"Software Innovations Lab, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA",Distributed applications; Evolutionary modifications; Automated refactoring,"Actively used software applications must be changed continuously to ensure their utility, correctness, and performance. To perform these changes, programmers spend a considerable amount of time and effort pinpointing the exact locations in the code to modify, a particularly hard task for distributed applications. In distributed applications, server/middleware misconfigurations and network volatility often cause performance and correctness problems. My dissertation research puts forward a novel approach to facilitating the evolutionary modifications of distributed applications that introduces a novel automated refactoring—Client Insourcing. This refactoring transforms a distributed application into its semantically equivalent centralized variant, in which the remote parts are glued together and communicate with each other by means of regular function calls, eliminating any middleware, server, and network-related problems from the list of potential problem causes. Programmers then can use the resulting centralized variant to facilitate debugging, security enhancements, and fault-tolerance adaptations (Some of the preliminary work of this dissertation is described in a paper accepted for presentation in the main technical program of ICWE 2019 [4]).",International Conference on Web Engineering,2019,548-553,6,7,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19274-7_43

The existing tensor decomposition studies used static dataset in their analyses. However, in practice, data change and increase over time. Therefore, this paper proposes an incremental Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) tensor decomposition algorithm for three-dimensional tensors. The method of incremental tensor decomposition can reduce recalculation costs associated with the addition of new tensors. The proposed method is called InParTen; it performs distributed incremental PARAFAC tensor decomposition based on the Apache Spark framework. The proposed method decomposes only new tensors and then combines them with existing results without recalculating the complete tensors. In this study, it was assumed that the tensors grow with time as the majority of the dataset is added over a period. In this paper, the performance of InParTen was evaluated by comparing the obtained results for execution time and relative errors against existing tensor decomposition tools. Consequently, it has been observed that the method can reduce the recalculation cost of tensor decomposition.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2019,63-71,9,5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-19274-7_5

In content-driven graph analytics, knowledge must be extracted from large numbers of available data graphs. As the number of datasets (a different type of volume) can reach immense sizes, a thorough evaluation of each input is prohibitively expensive. To date, there exists no efficient method to quantify the impact of numerous available datasets over different graph analytics tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient graph operator modeling methodology. Our novel, operator-agnostic approach focuses on the inputs themselves, utilizing graph similarity to infer knowledge about them.

We make the hypothesis that such interesting users can be found within temporally and spatially localised contexts, i.e., small but topical fragments of the network containing interactions about social events or campaigns with a significant footprint on Twitter. To explore this hypothesis, we have designed a continuous user profile discovery pipeline that produces an ever-growing dataset of user profiles by harvesting and analysing contexts from the Twitter stream. The profiles dataset includes key network and content-based users metrics, enabling experimentation with user-defined score functions that characterise specific classes of online users.

Voice-based interaction like dialogue systems is the current emerging trend in these systems. Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model can identify the end-users’ intentions in the utterances provided to spoken dialogue systems. The utility of dialogue systems is reliant on the quality of NLU models, which is in turn significantly dependent on the availability of a high-quality and sufficiently large corpus for training, containing diverse utterance structures. However, building such corpora is a complex task even for companies possessing significant human and infrastructure resources. On the other hand, the existing corpora for the smart home domain are either concerned with web services, focus on direct goals only, follow static command structure, or are not publicly available in English language which limits the development of goal-oriented dialogue systems for smart homes. In this paper, we propose a generic method to create training data for the NLU component using a generative grammar-based approach. Our method outputs, Voice Interaction in Smart Home (VISH) dataset consisting of five million unique utterances for the smart home. This dataset can greatly facilitate research in the area of voice-based dialogue systems for smart homes. We evaluate the approach by using VISH to train several state-of-the-art NLU models.

We collected subjective assessments of Aesthetics, Complexity and Orderliness from 137 human participants for more than 3000 homepages from 7 domains, and used them to train 21 artificial neural network (ANN) models. The input neurons were 32 quantitative metrics obtained via computer vision-based analysis of the homepages screenshots. Then, we tested how well each ANN model can predict subjective assessments for websites from other domains, and correlated the changes in prediction accuracies with the pairwise distances between the domains. We found that the Complexity scale was rather domain-independent, whereas “foreign-domain” models for Aesthetics and Orderliness had on average greater prediction errors for other domains, by 60% and 45%, respectively.

Thus, in order to protect users from attacks, it is necessary to detect those malicious codes before they are executed. Since the types of malicious codes increase quickly, it is difficult for the traditional static and dynamic approaches to detect new style of malicious code. In recent years, machine learning has been used in malicious code identification approaches. However, a large number of labeled samples are required to achieve good performance, which is difficult to acquire.

Automatic Model Completion for Web Applications,"Ruilian Zhao, Chen Chen, Weiwei Wang & Junxia Guo","Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, 100029, China",Model completion; Web applications; EFSM model; Lookahead search,"Model-based testing is one of the most effective methods for testing web applications, where the integrity of models determines the effectiveness and efficiency of testing. Static/dynamic analysis techniques are widely used to construct models for web applications. However, it is almost impossible to build a complete model for web applications by static analysis techniques since web applications are driven by events, and web pages are generated dynamically. Dynamic analysis techniques construct models through monitoring the execution of web applications and capturing the pivotal behavior information. But it is challenging to explore all possible behaviors, resulting in incomplete models. So, the combination of dynamic and static analysis techniques is a viable way to construct a more complete model for web applications. Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM) is considered more suitable to represent modern web applications. So this paper defines an integrity criterion for EFSM models of web applications and proposes a model completion method by combining dynamic analysis and static analysis techniques. Static analysis is used to collect all behaviors from the source code of web application, identify the uncovered ones from the EFSM model built according to the integrity criterion, and find feasible transition sequences for the uncovered behaviors on the EFSM model. Furthermore, we design multiple priority rules for transition sequence generation to improve its efficiency. The dynamic analysis is employed to simulate the execution of feasible transition sequences on the EFSM model such that the uncovered behaviors can be added into the model to improve its integrity. We implement our method in a prototype tool called AutoMC and conduct a series of experiments on five open-source web applications. The experiment results show that our method can complete the model of web applications, and the priority rules provide effective guidance in transition sequence generation.

It aims at predicting missing links between entities to complement KGs. The most successful methods for this problem are embedding-based. Most previous works only consider the triples to learn the embeddings of entities and relations, so the information they can utilize is limited. However, KGs are graph-structured data, we can use the neighborhood information to improve the quality of embeddings, thus improving the performance of link prediction task. In this paper, we propose NAE (neighborhood aggregation embedding model), a novel approach for link prediction. NAE consists of an aggregator and a predictor. The aggregator aggregates the embeddings of multi-order neighbors with different weights to generate a new embedding for each entity. Further analysis shows that the performance of some existing methods such as TransE and DistMult can be improved by integrating our aggregators. The predictor predicts the probability distributions of target entities. It uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture more interactions between the new entity embeddings and the relation embeddings. We also propose a highly parameter efficient model NAE-S by simplifying the predictor, which can obtain competitive performance with fewer parameters. Compared with DistMult, NAE-S achieves the same performance with 16x fewer parameters.

ARTEMIS is able to create and capture artificial emotions during interactions with its environment, and we describe the underlying mechanisms for this. The control system also realizes the capturing of knowledge about its past artificial emotions. A specific interpretation of a knowledge graph, called an Agent Knowledge Graph, represents these artificial emotions. For this, we devise a formalism which enriches the traditional factual knowledge in knowledge graphs with the representation of artificial emotions. As proof of concept, we realize a concrete software agent based on the ARTEMIS control system. This software agent acts as a user assistant and executes the user’s orders. The environment of this user assistant consists of autonomous service agents. The execution of user’s orders requires interaction with these autonomous service agents. These interactions lead to artificial emotions within the assistant. The first experiments show that it is possible to realize an autonomous agent with plausible artificial emotions with ARTEMIS and to record these artificial emotions in its Agent Knowledge Graph. In this way, autonomous agents based on ARTEMIS can capture essential knowledge that supports successful planning and decision making in complex dynamic environments and surpass emotionless agents.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2020,277-292,16,7,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50578-3_19

Discovering alternatives to reach destinations and obtaining live updates about them is necessary to optimize journeys and improve the quality of travellers’ experience. However, keeping travellers updated with opportune information is demanding. Traditional Web APIs for live public transport data follow a polling approach and allocate all data processing on either data providers, lowering data accessibility, or data consumers, increasing the costs of innovative solutions. Moreover, data processing load increases further because previously obtained route plans are fully recalculated when live updates occur. In between solutions sharing processing load between clients and servers, and alternative Web API architectures were not thoroughly investigated yet. We study performance trade-offs of polling and push-based Web architectures to efficiently publish and consume live public transport data. We implement (i) alternative architectures that allow sharing data processing load between clients and servers, and evaluate their performance following polling- and push-based approaches; (ii) a rollback mechanism that extends the Connection Scan Algorithm to avoid unnecessary full route plan recalculations upon live updates. Evaluations show polling as a more efficient alternative on CPU and RAM but hint towards push-based alternatives when bandwidth is a concern. Clients update route plan results 8–10 times faster with our rollback approach. Smarter API design combining polling and push-based Web interfaces for live public transport data reduces the intrinsic costs of data sharing by equitably distributing the processing load between clients and servers.

Considering the amount of users on microblogging platforms, the rumor spreading on microblogging platform could have a negative effect on individuals, groups and the whole society. Hence, automatic rumor detection is an important research issue. Stance information contains crucial features for rumor detection, because users discussing rumors tend to express more querying and denying stances. Moreover, different user stances have different importance. Motivated by this inspiration, in this paper, we propose a Rumor Detection Model with a Hybrid Stance Attention Mechanism (RDM-HSAM). The RDM-HSAM consists of four modules. The first module is a stance module, in which the tweet-level stance representation is constructed. The second module is the attention module in which a hybrid attention mechanism is used to construct the event-level stance representation of a microblogging event. The hybrid attention mechanism is consisted of two attention mechanisms, i.e. content attention mechanism and user attention mechanism which are applied at the stance information and user profile respectively. The third module is a rumor module which captures the content features and temporal features of a microblogging event. The fourth module is an integrate module in which event-level stance representations and rumor representations are concatenated together to detect rumors. Experiments on a real-world dataset from Weibo platform demonstrate that our proposed model RDM-HSAM improves the performance of rumor detection in terms of both efficiency and accuracy compared to other methods, and the accuracy of our model achieves 94.9%.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2020,347-364,18,5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50578-3_24

One issue is that saving the whole execution state of a running app including all objects in the runtime heap will be inefficient, since most of the current states are unchanged from the initial state. To reduce this inefficiency, we propose WebDelta which selectively saves only those that are modified from the initial state. This selective snapshot is saved as a patch file so that after migration, once the original app is launched, the current state can be restored by applying the patch file. We model the relationship between the JavaScript objects as a directed graph to efficiently and completely save the delta of the JavaScript state. We solve the challenging issues related to modified closure variables or modified event handlers attached to the DOM objects. Our framework could successfully migrate five real web apps, and we could speed up the total migration time as much as by 2.7x.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2020,435-450,16,3,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50578-3_29

It removes the need for a centralized server while hiding behind a framework the complexity of building P2P extensions.

Open universities are a typical example of non-traditional educational institutes. Online learning and blended learning models are often utilized in open universities because the students rarely study full time. In this paper, we present a study where four programming and computer science courses were taught in the Open University and in the university at the same time. A blended learning methodology was used to teach the courses in the university. The students in the open university could decide freely whether they wanted to take the courses fully online or to participate into classroom sessions as well. Moreover, no lectures were given in the open university. Instead, the students could download lecture handouts and other material online. The results from continuous assessment and the final exam of four shared IT/CS courses were analyzed.

Moreover, with the advent of the concept of Everything-as-a-Service (XaaS), a cloud-based term that allows for a wide variety of services and applications deployed by the user, the multiple devices scenario gain more relevance, mainly due to the lack of interoperability between operating systems and services of these devices. We focus on multiple device’s environments for synchronizing web services at the client-side without continuously depending on a cloud-based system. We discuss a model-based architecture that allows us to fluently migrate services/data and sessions from one device to another regardless of the operating system. The architecture, called The CUBE [12], is based on user-centric principles combined with REST and RESTful concepts. In this extension paper, we present two main contributions. First, with a description of technical and conceptual aspects of the CUBE, and its relation with the devices/applications and web services. Then, a feasibility test for a tight-coupling service such as YouTube streaming. Within a set of ten users, we presented preliminary results that had measured the wasted time to play a given video with and without the CUBE towards five different devices. The results demonstrate that when the users used the CUBE, they spend only 5.821 s to migrate the video, while without the CUBE, they spend 68.101 s to do the same procedure.

In order to manage this open data, Web APIs with accurate documentation are highly recommended features that not all platforms include. Providing these APIs would help developers to easily access data, but this access is still limited for end-users, particularly those with disabilities. Therefore, there is a gap between open data and users in which our APIfication approach can help by creating APIs for available datasets. It consists of a model-based generation of suitable APIs with natural language documentation to access open data, a universal API to access linked open data easily and a Web augmentation framework to improve data accessibility, helping users with disabilities.

Accelerating Web Start-up with Resource Preloading,"JiHwan Yeo, Jae-Hyeon Rim, ChangHyun Shin & Soo-Mook Moon","Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea",Web browser; Resource preloading; Smart device,"Long start-up time of web apps or web pages at the client device may affect the user experience negatively. One bottleneck in reducing the start-up time is resource loading overhead. To reduce the overhead, resource preloading has been proposed, which load resources ahead of time, instead of loading them on time when they are used. For commercial client device such as smart TV, it is reasonable for the browser of the client to do resource preloading. Existing client-only technique remembers the resources accessed in the previous visit and then preloads them in the current visit. However, it preloads the resources in some arbitrary order, thus not dealing well when the preloading order is important, especially for user experience. One solution is employing a resource dependence graph, often used for preloading with proxy servers or web servers, but in client-only environment we need to compute the graph while preloading is in progress, and update the graph incrementally when the resources change. This paper proposes such a dependence graph-based, client-only resource preloading technique. For better user experience, we decide the preloading order based on those factors that affect user perception such as the size or the location of images in the screen. Our experimental results on Chromium browser with real web apps on an embedded board and on a commercial smart TV show that the proposed technique can improve the UX-related app start-up time (above-the-fold time or speed index) tangibly, allowing the user to really feel the difference.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2020,37-52,16,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50578-3_4

Hence, in many cases, conducting an exploratory study is required to discover which semantic features are used or defined in a knowledge graph. In this paper, we propose an ontology and a large-scale ontology-based Web service that provides statistics about the use of OWL 2 and RDFS semantic features (e.g. functional properties or subclasses) in knowledge graphs. This will allow a human or automatic agent to choose the most appropriate tool or data for a given task.

The service decomposition is the act of decomposing (breaking) a coarse-grained service into a set of fine-grained services that collectively perform the functionality of the original service. The service decomposition introduces additional overhead due to inter-service communication of services which impacts the performance. In this paper, we study the effect of service decomposition on the throughput and average latency. We perform an extensive performance analysis using a set of standard microservice benchmarks with different workload characteristics. Our results indicate that when we decompose a service into a set of micro-services the performance of the new application can improve or degrade. The factors which impact the performance behaviours are the number of service calls, the service demand, concurrency (i.e. number of concurrent users) and the decomposition strategy. In addition to the experimental performance evaluation, we analyze the performance impact of service decomposition using queueing theoretic models.

In the state of the art, it is clear that pushing delivers a lower latency compared to pulling, however, this has not been tested for an Open Data usage scenario where 15 k clients are not an exception. Also, there are no general guidelines when to use a polling or push-based approach for publishing live changing resources on the Web. We performed (i) a field report of live Open datasets on the European and U.S. Open Data portal and (ii) a benchmark between HTTP polling and Server-Sent Events (SSE) under a load of 25 k clients. In this article, we compare the scalability and latency of updates on the client between polling and pushing. For the scenario where users want to receive an update as fast as possible, we found that SSE excels above polling in three aspects: lower CPU usage on the server, lower latency on the client and more than double the number of clients that can be served. However, considering that users can perceive a certain maximum latency on the client (MAL) of an update acceptable, we describe in this article at which MAL point a polling interface can be able to serve a higher number of clients than pushing.

A Credit Scoring Model for SMEs Based on Social Media Data,"Septian Gilang Permana Putra, Bikash Joshi & Judith Redi; Alessandro Bozzon","Delft University of Technology, Delft, Netherlands; Exact Software, Delft, Netherlands",,"Credit scoring is an important tool to assess the solidity of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and to unlock for them new options for credit and improvement of cash flow. Credit scoring is, in its most common form, used by (potential) creditors to predict the probability of SMEs to default in the future, as an inverse measure of creditworthiness. The majority of existing credit scoring methods for SMEs are solely based on the analysis of SMEs’ financial data. While straightforward, these methods have major limitations: they may rely on very incomplete or outdated data, and fail to capture the very dynamic environment in which the business of SMEs evolves. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to credit scoring for SMEs by enriching traditionally used financial data with social media data. We carried out our analysis on 25654 SMEs in the Netherlands, using 20 traditional financial indicators and 35 social media features. Experimental results suggest that the use of social media data in addition to traditional data significantly improves the quality of the credit scoring model for SMEs.

Towards Large-Scale Empirical Assessment of Web APIs Evolution,"Fabio Di Lauro, Souhaila Serbout & Cesare Pautasso","Software Institute, USI, Lugano, Switzerland",Web API; API evolution; OpenAPI,"Web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) decouple the internal implementation of a service from its consumers which can reuse and compose them to rapidly build new applications. Many Web APIs are described with the OpenAPI Specification (OAS). The goal of our research is to check the feasibility of using API descriptions found in public open source repositories to study how APIs evolve over time. To do so, we collected a large dataset of OAS documents by crawling open source repositories, we parsed the corresponding metadata and measured the API size in order to extract a simple model to track the lifecycle of API artifacts and observe common evolution behaviors. Our preliminary results indicate that only a subset of the APIs changes, but as opposed to the expectation that APIs should only grow to maintain backward compatibility we also detected a number of APIs with a more variable history. We also study the stability of API artifacts over time and whether APIs are more or less likely to change as they age.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2021,124-138,15,13,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-74296-6_10
Stability Metrics for Continuous Integration of Service-Oriented Systems,Dionysis Athanasopoulos & Daniel Keenan,"School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK",Software stability; Service API; Evolution; Continuous integration,"One of the key principles of the service orientation is the standardised service contract. However, the assumption that the service contract is kept unmodified during the whole life-cycle of a system is not always held. Evolution changes on the service APIs have an impact on the maintainability of their programming clients within the system making difficult the continuous integration of the services. The metrics that have currently been applied for the service maintainability assess the service coupling, cohesion, complexity, and granularity. Software stability can further contribute in assessing the maintainability of systems. However, it is challenging to measure the stability of service APIs without having evolved their programming clients, because it should be measured by considering the types of the evolution changes in APIs that have direct impact on the programming clients. To address this challenge, we define a set of mappings between evolved service APIs based on which the stability changes can be determined. We further specify a generic algorithm that recognises the evolution changes required on the programming clients of the evolved APIs. We finally define an initial version of a suite of metrics that estimate the stability of a service system without assuming the existence of the evolved programming clients.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2021,139-147,9,0,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-74296-6_11

Most previous methods used attention-based neural network models to Establish connections between aspect categories and sentiment words and generate aspect-specific sentence representations. However, these models may mismatch sentiment words with aspect categories due to the complexity of sentence structures. To solve this problem, we reconstruct the dependency tree into an ACSA-oriented dependency tree, which builds a direct or indirect semantic connection between sentiment words and corresponding aspect categories, and avoid introducing redundant information from the original dependency tree. On this basis, we propose a Sentence Dependent-Aware Network (SDAN) to encode the tree effectively.

To solve the problem, we design an auxiliary task, where a dynamic semantic matching block is introduced to capture the hidden features with example-based learning. Besides, we provide a hierarchical model that can extract semantic features at both sentence-level and document-level.

This work focuses on the problem of ranking type-based facets. In a structured information space, type-based facets (t-facets) indicate the category to which each object belongs. When they belong to a large multi-level taxonomy, it is desirable to rank them separately before ranking other facet groups. This helps the searcher in filtering the results according to their type first. This also makes it easier to rank the rest of the facets once the type of the intended search target is selected. Existing research employs the same ranking methods for different facet groups. In this research, we propose a two-step approach to personalize t-facet ranking. The first step assigns a relevance score to each individual leaf-node t-facet. The score is generated using probabilistic models and it reflects t-facet relevance to the query and the user profile. In the second step, this score is used to re-order and select the sub-tree to present to the user. We investigate the usefulness of the proposed method to a Point Of Interest (POI) suggestion task.

Most of these neighborhood-based models use the actual ratings from neighbors to predict the ratings of the target user toward target items, which often leads to a low accuracy prediction caused by the improper rating-range problem. Recently, rating conversion methods have been proposed to address this issue. Because each friend/neighbor can have a different level of influence on the target user, we propose a friend module, which converts their ratings to match the target user’s perspective and assigns different weight to each user before modeling latent relations and predictions. In rating conversion, ratings that involve explicit feedback are important. Instead of the traditional approach to user embedding, we propose a novel approach that uses explicit feedback. This can express user features better than traditional methods and can then be used to convert ratings to match the target user’s perspective. For better representation and recommendation, we also learn latent relations between each user and item by adopting knowledge graph ideas, which leads to more accurate results.

However, as genuine tables containing relational knowledge only account for a small proportion of tables on the web, reliable genuine web table classification is a crucial first step of table extraction. Previous works usually rely on explicit feature construction from the HTML code. In contrast, we propose an approach for web table classification by exploiting the full visual appearance of a table, which works purely by applying a convolutional neural network on the rendered image of the web table. Since these visual features can be extracted automatically, our approach circumvents the need for explicit feature construction. A new hand labeled gold standard dataset containing HTML source code and images for 13,112 tables was generated for this task. Transfer learning techniques are applied to well known VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures. The evaluation of CNN image classification with fine tuned ResNet50 (F1 93.29%) shows that this approach achieves results comparable to previous solutions using explicitly defined HTML code based features.

In recent years, advancements in graph-structured deep neural networks have attracted considerable interest and achieved state-of-the-art performance on recommender system benchmarks. However, existing graph-based recommendation methods generally characterize each user with just one representation vector, which is insufficient to convey diverse preferences of users. To address this issue, in this paper, we approach the learning of user representations from a different perspective, by modeling users based on multiple representation embeddings. We propose a Multiple Preferences with Item Attributes for Graph Convolutional Collaborative Filtering (MPIA) framework built upon the message-aggregation concept of graph neural networks, which can generate preference-specific user representations to better model the diverse preferences of users. By taking advantage of graph representation learning techniques, MPIA learns preference-specific embeddings for users and attribute-specific embeddings for items. Moreover, we utilize shared embeddings for user and item representations to obtain the commonalities in multiple networks. Specifically, we construct a user-item bipartite graph for each preference, and enrich the representation of each node with the topological structure and features of its neighbors. We also design a preference-attribute fusion method to acquire more accurate item retrievals for every aspect of interest.

This paper evaluates the impact of performing knowledge base integration (KBI) to regulate the dialogue output of a deep learning conversational system. More specifically, it evaluates whether integrating dependencies between the data, obtained from the semantic linking of an external knowledge base (KB), would help improve conversational quality. To do so, we compare three approaches of conversation preprocessing methods: i) no KBI: considering conversational data with no external knowledge integration, ii) All Predicates KBI: considering conversational data where all dialogue pairs are augmented with their linked predicates from the domain KB, and iii) Intersecting Predicates KBI: considering conversational data where dialogue pairs are augmented only with their intersecting predicates (to filter-out potentially useless or redundant knowledge). We vary the amount of history considered in the conversational data, ranging from 0% (considering the last dialogue pair only) to 100% (considering all dialogue pairs, from the beginning of the dialogue). To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate knowledge integration in the preprocessing phase of conversational systems.

Attempts to simplify privacy policies using natural language processing have achieved some success, but they face limitations of scalability and generalization. While this puts an onus on researchers and policy regulators to protect users against unfair privacy practices, they often lack a large-scale collection of policies to study the state of internet privacy. To remedy this bottleneck, we present PrivaSeer, the first privacy policy search engine.

Results also can be filtered by readability, vagueness, industry, and mentions of tracking technology, self-regulatory bodies, or regulations and cross-border agreements in the policy text. PrivaSeer allows legal experts, researchers, and policy regulators to discover privacy trends and policy anomalies in privacy policies at scale.

However, given the current fragmentation of the IoT domain, designing a mashup is still a manual task that is time-consuming and error-prone. The introduction of the Thing Description (TD) from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is meant to facilitate the interoperability between IoT devices and platforms by providing a standardized format to describe the network interfacing of entities, called Things, participating in the Web of Things (WoT). Furthermore, the System Description (SD) extension introduces the notion of Atomic Mashups (AMs), small mashup building blocks that are easier to design. However, designing AMs remains a manual task and, given the rising complexity of IoT devices, manually exploring the resulting design space is infeasible.

Communicating Web Vessels: Improving the Responsiveness of Mobile Web Apps with Adaptive Redistribution,Kijin An & Eli Tilevich,"Software Innovations Lab, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, USA",Mobile web apps; Javascript; Dynamic adaptation; Program analysis & transformation; Web frameworks,"In a mobile web app, a browser-based client communicates with a cloud-based server across the network. An app is statically divided into client and server functionalities, so the resulting division remains fixed at runtime. However, if such static division mismatches the current network conditions and the device’s processing capacities, app responsiveness and energy efficiency can deteriorate rapidly. To address this problem, we present Communicating Web Vessels (CWV), an adaptive redistribution framework that improves the responsiveness of full-stack JavaScript mobile apps. Unlike standard computation offloading, in which client functionalities move to run on the server, CWV’s redistribution is bidirectional. Without any preprocessing, CWV enables apps to move any functionality from the server to the client and vice versa at runtime, thus adapting to the ever-changing execution environment of the web. Having moved to the client, former server functionalities become regular local functions.

To migrate a stateful JavaScript app’s runtime, past studies have proposed snapshot-based techniques in which the app’s runtime state is profiled and serialized into a text form that can be restored back later. A common limitation of existing literature, however, is that they are based on old JavaScript specifications. Since major updates introduced by ECMASCript2015 (a.k.a. ES6), JavaScript supports various features that cannot be migrated correctly with existing methods. Some of these features are in fact heavily used in today’s real-world apps and thus greatly reduces the scope of previous works.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2021,404-419,16,5,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-74296-6_31

An off-the-shelf numerical solver is used to generate a layout that satisfies the constraints, in such a way that disruptions to the original page are minimized. A probe then injects these corrections in the form of a temporary “hotfix”.

When starting an app project, practitioners are faced with a plethora of development approaches to choose from. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a novel and promising approach for mobile cross-platform development (MCPD). As mobile devices are limited regarding battery capacity, the energy footprint of a mobile app should be kept as low as possible. Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the difference in energy consumption of PWAs and other mobile development approaches with a focus on UI rendering and interaction scenarios. For this, we implemented five versions of the same app with different development approaches and examined their energy footprint on two Android devices with four execution scenarios. The results show that the used development approach influences the energy footprint of a mobile app. Native development shows the lowest energy consumption. PWAs, albeit not the lowest energy consuming mobile development approach, are a viable alternative to other MCPD approaches. Moreover, the web-browser engine used to execute the PWA has a significant influence on the energy footprint of the app.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2021,464-479,16,34,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-74296-6_35
Static Analysis of Large-Scale JavaScript Front End,Anton Karakochev & Gefei Zhang,"Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin, Berlin, Germany",,"In modern web applications, the elaborate GUI of the front end is often developed with large-scale JavaScript frameworks. In such systems, the behavior of one HTML element is usually defined by code in different JavaScript functions scattered all over the source files, and a piece of code may also have influence on other functions and variables all over the source files. Therefore, the data and control flow of the front end may be hard to follow. We propose an automated approach to integrate the overall data and control flow of the front end into an overview model, which then provides us with an excellent starting point to application of formal methods to prove the correctness of the front end.

More and more companies and governmental organizations are making their data available online following the Open Data philosophy, resulting in a growing market of technologies and services to help publish and consume data. One of the emergent ways to publish such data is via Web APIs, which offer a powerful means to reuse this data and integrate it with other services. Socrata, CKAN or OData are examples of popular specifications for publishing data via Web APIs. Nevertheless, querying and integrating these Web APIs is time-consuming and requires technical skills that limit the benefits of Open Data movement for the regular citizen. In other contexts, chatbot applications are being increasingly adopted as a direct communication channel between companies and end-users. We believe the same could be true for Open Data as a way to bridge the gap between citizens and Open Data sources.

As the budget of a PSB to publish their dataset on the Web is finite, PSBs need guidance on what interface to offer first. A core API can be designed that covers the core tasks of Base Registries, which is a well-defined term in Flanders for the management of authoritative datasets. This core API should be the basis on which an ecosystem of data services can be built. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a Linked Data Event Stream (LDES) for datasets like air quality sensors and observations or a registry of officially registered addresses. We show that extra ecosystem requirements can be built on top of the LDES using a generic fragmenter. By using hypermedia for describing the LDES as well as the derived datasets, agents can dynamically discover their best way through the KG, and server administrators can dynamically add or remove functionality based on costs and needs. This way, we allow PSBs to prioritize API functionality based on three tiers: (i) the LDES, (ii) intermediary indexes and (iii) querying interfaces.

In the Semantic Web domain, ontologies are one way to achieve semantic interoperability by using a common vocabulary that represents heterogeneous sources. However, recent studies have shown that the amount of concept reuse from existing IoT ontologies is low. As the number of IoT ontologies increases, encouraging users to reuse existing ontologies instead of creating new concepts becomes important. Ontology catalogues are a prominent approach to discover and inspect existing ontologies for reuse. However, such catalogues inspect the ontologies using general criteria which is not enough to understand the content of the ontology. In this paper, we propose a method for automatic ontology inspection (OntoSpect) of IoT ontologies from different application domains based on a generic set of content-related concepts. OntoSpect consists of two main steps: first it extracts the set of IoT concepts, and then generates human-understandable descriptions using a Model-driven Engineering (MDE) approach. We evaluate the quality of concept extraction and natural language description generation with 84 ontologies retrieved from the LOV4IoT catalogue and report on quality metrics. In addition, we conduct an empirical study with 28 ontology users to further assess the quality of the generated descriptions.

High-Level Interaction Design with Discourse Models for Automated Web GUI Generation,Hermann Kaindl,"TU Wien, Vienna, Austria",Interaction design; Discourse models; Task models; Automated Web GUI generation; Customization; Low-vision accessibility of Web-pages,"Interaction design is considered important for achieving usable Web user interfaces. Communicative acts as abstractions from speech acts can model basic building blocks (‘atoms’) of communication, like a question or an answer. When, e.g., a question and an answer are glued together as a so-called adjacency pair, a simple ‘molecule’ of a dialogue is modeled. Deliberately complex discourse structures can be modeled using relations from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The content of a communicative act can refer to ontologies of the domain of discourse. Taking all this together, we created a new discourse metamodel that specifies what discourse models may look like. Such discourse models can specify an interaction design. Since manual creation of user interfaces is hard and expensive, automated generation may become more and more important. This tutorial also demonstrates how such an interaction design can be used for automated Web user-interface generation. This is based on model-transformation rules according to the model-driven architecture. Based on AI optimization techniques, the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are automatically tailored to a device such as a smartphone according to a given device specification. Since the usability of fully-automatically generated GUIs is still not satisfactory, unique customization techniques are employed as well.

When a dataset becomes too large to be embedded in the page, setting up a full-text search API is not the only alternative. Alternate API designs that balance different trade-offs such as archivability, cacheability and privacy, may not require setting up a new back-end architecture. In this paper, we propose to perform prefix search over a fragmentation of the dataset, enabling the client to take part in the query execution by navigating through the fragmented dataset. Our proposal consists of (i) a self-describing fragmentation strategy, (ii) a client search algorithm, and (iii) an evaluation of the proposed solution, based on a small dataset of 73k entities and a large dataset of 3.87 m entities. We found that the server cache hit ratio is three times higher compared to a server-side prefix search API, at the cost of a higher bandwidth consumption. Nevertheless, an acceptable user-perceived performance has been measured: assuming 150 ms as an acceptable waiting time between keystrokes, this approach allows 15 entities per prefix to be retrieved in this interval. We conclude that an alternate set of trade-offs has been established for specific prefix search use cases: having added more choice to the spectrum of Web APIs for autocompletion, a file-based approach enables more datasets to afford prefix search.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2021,53-67,15,2,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-74296-6_5

A substantial amount of research has been devoted to ascertaining the quality of reviews, to identify the most useful and authentic scores through explanation analysis. In this paper, we advance the state of the art in review quality analysis. We introduce a rating system to identify review arguments and to define an appropriate weighted semantics through formal argumentation theory. We introduce an algorithm to construct a corresponding graph, based on a selection of weighted arguments, their semantic similarity, and the supported ratings. We provide an algorithm to identify the model of such an argumentation graph, maximizing the overall weight of the admitted nodes and edges. We evaluate these contributions on the Amazon review dataset by McAuley et al. [15], by comparing the results of our argumentation assessment with the upvotes received by the reviews. Also, we deepen the evaluation by crowdsourcing a multidimensional assessment of reviews and comparing it to the argumentation assessment. Lastly, we perform a user study to evaluate the explainability of our method.

Human-labeled datasets are particularly indispensable for ML-based validation and design of user interfaces (UIs). The production of such datasets is often outsourced to crowdworkers, who typically have lower motivation and payment compared to in-house staff, so the quality of their work becomes the paramount concern. In our paper, we explore the applicability of the trending fraud detection approach based on fit to power law in crowdsourced web UI labeling. On Amazon Mechanical Turk, 298 crowdworkers labeled over 30,000 UI elements in about 500 university homepage screenshots. We found a significant correlation between workers’ precisions and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics-based goodness-of-fit between the frequencies of UI elements in a worker’s output and power law.

Studying these conversations is essential for understanding the online communication behavior of users. This study proposes a novel approach to retrieve popular patterns on online conversations using network-based analysis. The analysis consists of two main stages: intent analysis and network generation. Users’ intention is detected using keyword-based categorization of posts and comments, integrated with classification through Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine algorithms for uncategorized comments. A continuous human-in-the-loop approach further improves the keyword-based classification. To build and understand communication patterns among the users, we build conversation graphs starting from the hierarchical structure of posts and comments, using a directed multigraph network. The experiments categorize 90% comments with 98% accuracy on a real social media dataset. The model then identifies relevant patterns in terms of shape and content; and finally determines the relevance and frequency of the patterns. Results show that the most popular online discussion patterns obtained from conversation graphs resemble real-life interactions and communication.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2021,97-112,16,14,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-74296-6_8

Web-based testbeds add key advantages like results sharing, remote test execution, and collaboration. Focusing on their research objectives, creators see their testbeds as a means to that end. The resulting web-based testbeds are similar in structure and functionality, but there is no common architecture supporting their creation, introducing redundant design efforts. Therefore, we determine structural similarities based on insights into the architecture of current web-based testbeds, from which we derive a generic web-based testbed architecture.

General-purpose SDC approaches such as Brotli reduce complexity by shipping the same dictionary for all use cases, while most delta encoding approaches just consider similarities between versions of the same entity (but not between different entities). In this study, we investigate how much of the potential benefits of SDC and delta encoding are left on the table by these two simplifications. As our first contribution, we describe the idea of cross-entity delta encoding that uses cached assets from the immediate browser history for content encoding instead of a precompiled shared dictionary: This avoids the need to create a custom dictionary, but enables highly customized and efficient compression. Second, we present an experimental evaluation of compression efficiency to hold cross-entity delta encoding against state-of-the-art Web compression algorithms. We consciously compare algorithms some of which are not yet available in browsers to understand their potential value before investing resources to build them. Our results indicate that cross-entity delta encoding is over 50% more efficient for text-based resources than compression industry standards.

Yet, there is very little research addressing how users’ feedback for particular items (such as ratings) can affect recommendations. This feedback can assist in building more fine-grained user profiles, as not all raw clicks will truly reflect a user’s preference. The challenge of encoding such records, which are typically prohibitively long, also prevents research from considering using the whole click history to learn representations. To address these challenges, we propose MARF, a novel model for click prediction. Specifically, we construct fine-grained user representations (by considering both the multiple items browsed, and user’s feedback on them) and item representations (by considering browsing histories from multiple users, and their feedback). Moreover, the flexible up-down strategy is designed to avoid loading incomplete or overloaded historical information by selecting representative users/items based on their feedback records. A comprehensive evaluation on three large scale real-world benchmark datasets, showing that MARF significantly outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art solutions.

Blockchain and Web3 has the potential to remove these intermediaries, instead allowing institutions to build trust among public servants and citizens through a decentralized web. It is feasible to positively reinforce the transparency in tackling corruption in public procurement by establishing an e-participatory governance infrastructure using token economics from smart-contract blockchain technology. The overall success of public procurement in terms of service delivery to citizens is associated with citizen e-participation. Thus, increased e-participation through automated processes makes the government accountable and transparent in the provision of services that lead to the progress and economic growth of a country. In this paper, we investigate the potential of blockchain and smart-contracts to improve the efficiency, trust, and transparency of public procurement in the case of Afghanistan.

Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNN) have led to a promising approach for addressing this problem. However, existing methods have three major issues. First, they are incapable of modeling the transitions between inconsecutive items. Second, they are infeasible for learning the cross-feature interactions when learning the item relationships. Third, very few models can adapt to the improvement of embedding quality to help improve recommendation performance. Therefore, to address these issues, we propose a novel model named M ultilevel F eature I nteractions L earning (MFIL) that effectively learns item and session representation using GNN. By leveraging item side information, e.g., brands and categories, MFIL can model transitions between inconsecutive items in the session graph (session-level). We further design hierarchical structures to learn the feature interactions, which is effective to estimate the importance weights of different neighboring items in the global graph (global-level). In addition, an effective learning strategy is employed to enhance MFIL’s capability, and it performs better than the classic regularization methods.

Together with an overview of state-of-the-art technologies, the tutorial focuses on two novel technologies: SPARQL Transformer, which allows to get a more compact JSON structure for SPARQL results, decreasing the effort required by developers in interfacing JavaScript and Python applications; and grlc, an automatic way of building APIs on top of SPARQL endpoints by sharing queries on collaborative platforms. Moreover, recent developments are presented to combine the two, offering a complete resource for developers and researchers. Hands-on sessions are proposed to internalise those concepts with practical exercises.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2022,501-504,4,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-09917-5_44

An In-Depth Analysis of Web Page Structure and Efficiency with Focus on Optimization Potential for Initial Page Load,Lucas Vogel & Thomas Springer,"TU Dresden, 01069, Dresden, Germany",Progressive page loading; Initial page load; Page streaming; User experience; User acceptance,"Web pages are nowadays usually built with a variety of different tools, frameworks, and generated code. The structure and size of the resulting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code highly influence the time for page load, and related energy consumption. However, no large-scale baseline data exists about the efficiency of the resulting page code, e.g., what amount of the code is actually used, or if code parts must be render-blocking. Furthermore, existing examinations analyze page code structure but do not investigate the potential impact on code efficiency if parts of the code would be optimized. In this paper, the top 10,000 web pages worldwide using the Tranco list were analyzed in-depth. Aspects with the highest impact on structure or performance are evaluated in detail and set into context regarding used techniques, frameworks, code efficiency, and differences in the delivered desktop- and mobile versions. The results showed that the vast majority (over 70% for JavaScript and \(\approx \)90% CSS) of externally loaded resources (both JavaScript and CSS) are loaded as render-blocking code. On average, only \(\approx \)40% of render-blocking JavaScript and \(\approx \)15% of CSS are used until page render, which unveils a significant potential for performance improvements for most analyzed websites.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2022,101-116,16,10,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-09917-5_7

Through the clustering of online posts concerning their topics, existing methods can quickly identify the current trends on social media, which helps discover marketing opportunities, prevent potential crises, etc. However, due to the diversity of social network users, the performance of current approaches is significantly affected by the long tail of random topics, which should be regarded as outliers in a clustering problem. Besides, current models are weak in detecting events that last for multiple days, which is common in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we propose the FS-GNN, a graph neural network based on a filtering strategy, for incremental social event detection in data streams. Our method uses heterogeneous information networks (HINs) to construct a social message graph, and we propose a centrality-based scoring mechanism to grade and filter noisy data before clustering. In addition, a message complement window is introduced to connect the same topic mentioned across multiple days for better clustering accuracy.

First, the DSNE is proposed to embed the DSN into a low-dimensional vector space to achieve the embeddings for efficient calculation of similarities on the search path. Then, the nearest neighbor descent algorithm is adopted to calculate the KNN graph.

Typical Web scraping systems such as “Dexi.io” or “Import.io” allow users to specify where to fetch the page and what information or data to be extracted from the page. Although these commercial services already provide a graphical user interface to guide the system to the target pages for each data source, such systems are not scalable because users have to create crawlers one by one. In this paper we consider the problem of pagination recognition, which aims to automate the process of finding similar pages by locating the next page link and the list of page links from any starting URL. We propose a neural sequence model that will label each clickable link in a page as either “NEXT”, “PAGE” or “Other”, where the first two could guide the system to find similar pages of the seed URL. To have multilingual support, we have exploited the attribute contents in the links as well as Language-Agnostic SEntence Representations (LASER) for anchor text embedding.

Disclosure: Efficient Instrumentation-Based Web App Migration for Liquid Computing,Jae-Yun Kim & Soo-Mook Moon,"Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea",Web app migration; Closure; Code instrumentation; Liquid computing; Multiple migration,"Web App migration means capturing a snapshot of the execution state of an web app on a device, and restoring it on another device to continue its execution, for cross-device liquid computing. Although web apps are relatively easy to migrate due to its high portability, there is a JavaScript language feature called closure, which complicates migration since it requires migrating the variable states of already-finished outer functions. One approach of web app migration is to instrument the source code to trace the closure variables, yet it often suffers from performance slowdown, especially for multiple migrations. In this paper, we propose a new instrumentation-based technique called Disclosure, which moves the declarations of closure variables to a managed data structure and replaces closure variables by the corresponding references to the data structure. This can improve the runtime performance while enhancing security. We evaluated our work with eight Octane benchmarks and four real web apps. The runtime performance penalty due to Disclosure is 0%–15%, which is much better than the result of the latest instrumentation-based work that supports deep closures and multiple migrations, as Disclosure.

Moreover, users can share the collected health data with other people, such as doctors, relatives, or friends. However, using technology-based approaches has raised the issue of privacy.

Results from our study indicate that user task performance is considerably affected by time constraints.

"Waiter and AUTRATAC: Don’t Throw It Away, Just Delay!",Lucas Vogel & Thomas Springer,"Technical University Dresden, 01069, Dresden, Germany",asynchronous JavaScript; code delay; code splitting; faster loading times; JavaScript framework,"The modern web is built with a mixture of HTML, CSS, and an increasing amount of JavaScript. Since JavaScript determines \(\approx \)70% of the overall data of websites on average, JavaScript code efficiency significantly influences their loading performance. A recent study revealed that the average JavaScript code usage until render is \(\approx \)40%. For economical and convenience reasons, a significant amount of research already focuses on optimizing the delivered data to reduce loading times. For example, a large area of research focuses on eliminating dead code, where unused functions are deleted. Code in this context is classified as “dead” when the results of the code or the whole code itself are never executed or used. Since code elimination is based on heuristics/code classification, there is always a trade-off between code elimination and missing JavaScript code that harms the correct functioning of the website. As a result, some pages do not load correctly after elimination. Even the most advanced attempts with user input emulation do not achieve 100% accuracy. In this paper, we introduce two new open-source frameworks called Waiter, which waits until a resource is available, and AUTRATAC, an automatic transpiler to awaitable code. Both can be used separately or in combination to robustly delay pieces of JavaScript code without breaking it. For example, it allows code to be executed without loading all called functions beforehand. Therefore, when eliminating dead code optimized with AUTRATAC, the loading of unused functions can be delayed in a non-render-blocking way. This also opens up multiple new opportunities, as future code-splitting techniques might be significantly stricter without breaking a page. Our results show that delaying render-blocking JavaScript reduces loading times until First Contentful Paint (FCP) significantly, especially at slower network speeds. In one instance, an 85% drop in loading time was measured. Furthermore, it was visible that deferring the code with the developed frameworks still matches the total code execution time of the original render-blocking JavaScript.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2023,278-292,15,9,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-34444-2_20
User Identity Linkage via Graph Convolutional Network Across Location-Based Social Networks,"Qian Li, Qian Zhou, Wei Chen & Lei Zhao","School of Computer Science and Technology, Soochow University, Suzhou, China",User identity linkage; Graph convolutional network; Location data; Spatial features,"In the past few decades, we have witnessed the flourishing of location-based social networks (LBSNs), where many users tend to create different accounts on multiple platforms to enjoy various services. Benefiting from the large-scale check-in data generated on LBSNs, the task of location-based user identity linkage (UIL) has attracted increasing attention recently. Despite the great contributions made by existing work on location-based UIL, they usually investigate the task with data mining methods, which are hard to extract and utilize the latent features contained by check-in records for more precise user identity linkage. In view of the deficiencies of existing studies, we propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) based model namely GCNUL that consists of a GCN-based encoder, an interaction layer, and a classifier, to fully exploit the spatial features hidden in check-in records.

Scraping Data from Web Pages Using SPARQL Queries,Radek Burget,"Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Bozetechova 2, 61266, Brno, Czechia",Web scraping; Page rendering; Data extraction; RDF; SPARQL,"Despite the increasing use of semantic data, plain old HTML web pages often provide a unique interface for accessing data from many domains. To use this data in computer applications or to integrate it with other data sources, it must be extracted from the HTML code. Currently, this is typically done by single-purpose programs called scrapers. For each data source, specific scrapers must be created, which requires a thorough analysis of the source page’s implementation in HTML. This makes writing and maintaining a set of scrapers a complex and time-consuming task. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that allows defining scrapers based on visual properties of the presented content instead of the HTML code structure. First, we render the source page and create an RDF graph that describes the visual properties of every piece of the displayed content. Next, we use SPARQL to query the model and extract the data. As we demonstrate with real-world examples, this approach allows us to easily define more robust scrapers that can be used across multiple web sites and that better cope with changes in the source documents.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2023,293-300,8,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-34444-2_21

However, commercial factors only provide one piece of the overall picture. The success of community-driven platforms has profoundly changed how people consume and interact with music, and, consequently, our understanding of what popularity is. People discuss their favourite artists, archive knowledge regarding them and share their work through multimedia platforms. In this paper, we investigate how data from these platforms can provide a more comprehensive view on popularity and engagement regarding the long-tail of classical music composers. We combine album release data provided by MusicBrainz, the commitment of people in maintaining the composers’ Wikipedia pages and user engagement in classical music videos on YouTube.

Automated Web GUI Generation from High-Level Interaction Design with Discourse Models,Hermann Kaindl,"TU Wien, Vienna, Austria",Interaction design; Discourse models; Task models; Automated Web GUI generation; Customization; Low-vision accessibility of Web-pages,"Interaction design is considered important for achieving usable Web user interfaces. Communicative acts as abstractions from speech acts can model basic building blocks (‘atoms’) of communication, like a question or an answer. When, e.g., a question and an answer are glued together as a so-called adjacency pair, a simple ‘molecule’ of a dialogue is modeled. Deliberately complex discourse structures can be modeled using relations from Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST). The content of a communicative act can refer to ontologies of the domain of discourse. Taking all this together, we created a new discourse metamodel that specifies what discourse models may look like. Such discourse models can specify an interaction design. Since manual creation of user interfaces is hard and expensive, automated generation may become more and more important. This tutorial also demonstrates how such an interaction design can be used for automated Web GUI generation. This is based on model-transformation rules according to the model-driven architecture. Based on AI optimization techniques, the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are automatically tailored to a device such as a smartphone according to a given device specification. Since the usability of fully-automatically generated GUIs is still not satisfactory, unique customization techniques are employed as well.

Trajectories represent a lightweight and non-intrusive form of worker behavior signal. We base our analysis on previously collected datasets composed of thousands of assessment data records including information such as workers’ trajectories, workers’ assessments, and experts’ assessments. We model such behavior sequences as embeddings, to facilitate their management. Then, we: (1) use supervised methods to predict worker performance using a given ground truth; (2) perform an unsupervised analysis to provide insight into crowdsourcing quality when no gold standard is available. We test several supervised approaches which all beat the baseline we propose. Also, we identify significant differences between trajectory clusters in terms of assessments and worker performance.

The complexity increases when one cannot control all the components, like in IoT systems composed of third-party devices. The Web of Things standards by the W3C help with this by describing what one can do with an IoT device via network messages. However, no work has leveraged these standards to offer an observability solution that works with any set of IoT devices. This work addresses this gap by proposing a method to verify the correctness of the system by mining its specification from device interactions. Our approach can reverse engineer complex application logic in the form of UML Sequence Diagrams from the analysis of network messages of any protocol between the devices during system runtime, which can be used to programmatically assert the correctness of the mined specification. We have evaluated our approach with three case studies to assess our mining technique, the performance of our algorithms, and the applicability of our contributions to system verification in the IoT.

Based on HTTP/2 and Protocol Buffers, it provides highly performant, standardized, and polyglot communication across loosely coupled microservices and is increasingly preferred over REST- or GraphQL-based service APIs in practice. Despite its widespread adoption, gRPC lacks any advanced privacy techniques beyond transport encryption and basic token-based authentication. Such advanced techniques are, however, increasingly important for fulfilling regulatory requirements. For instance, anonymizing or otherwise minimizing (personal) data before responding to requests, or pre-processing data based on the purpose of the access may be crucial in certain usecases. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel approach for integrating such advanced privacy techniques into the gRPC framework in a practically viable way. Specifically, we present a general approach along with a working prototype that implements privacy techniques, such as data minimization and purpose limitation, in a configurable, extensible, and gRPC-native way utilizing a gRPC interceptor. We also showcase how to integrate this contribution into a realistic example of a food delivery use case. Alongside these implementations, a preliminary performance evaluation shows practical applicability with reasonable overheads.

Trusting Decentralized Web Data in a Solid-Based Social Network,"Valentin Siegert, Dirk Leichsenring & Martin Gaedke","Distributed and Self-organizing Systems, Chemnitz University of Technology, Chemnitz, Germany",null,"In our current data-centric society, there is a rising concern among individuals regarding their privacy and the degree of control they have over their personal data. In response to this growing demand for transparency and control, a recent initiative for web re-decentralization has emerged, wherein web applications no longer store data centrally. One of the prominent approaches aimed at re-decentralizing the web is Solid. Solid facilitates data storage in decentralized pods secured with web access control, enabling seamless connectivity of diverse data. However, the integration of decentralized data from various third-party pods in web applications poses a significant challenge, as the data’s trustworthiness may be compromised, potentially leading to malicious or harmful outcomes. Therefore, data integration necessitates a trust-aware decision, i.e., the extent to which the data is trustworthy enough to use despite its high heterogeneity. To enable such trust awareness for web applications utilizing decentralized data, we propose a trust-aware framework called TrADS for decentralized social networks. TrADS leverages the MVC pattern of web applications to integrate external data from Solid pods trust aware. The potentially malicious and harmful status of external data is an end-user concern. A web application must therefore be trust aware to provide a better user experience. Therefore, we evaluate the proposed trust-aware decentralized social network in terms of usability and transparency with 53 end users through an empirical study. The results demonstrate that the trust awareness component in TrADS can support end users in their trustworthy user experience.",International Conference on Web Engineering,2024,230-245,16,1,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-62362-2_16

Systems based on large language models seem to achieve top performance. However, these models may generate content that looks reasonable but is incorrect. They also lack transparency, making it impossible to exactly explain why a particular answer was generated. To tackle these problems we present the TraQuLA (Transparent QUestion-answering through Linguistic Analysis) system – a rule-based system developed through linguistic analysis of datasets of complex questions over DBpedia and Wikidata. TraQuLA defines a question’s type and extracts its semantic component candidates (named entities, properties and class names). For the extraction of properties, whose natural language verbalisations are most diverse, we built an extensive database which matches DBpedia/Wikidata properties to natural language expressions, allowing linguistic variation. TraQuLA generates semantic parses for the components and ranks them by each question’s structure and morphological features. The ranked parses are then analysed top down according to their patterns, also noting linguistic aspects, until a solution is found and a SPARQL query is produced. TraQuLA outperforms the existing baseline systems on the LC-QuAD 1.0 and competes with ChatGPT-based systems on LC-QuAD 2.0. For the LC-QuAD 1.0 test set, we developed an evaluation approach that accepts multiple ways to answer the questions (some ignored by the dataset) and curated some errors.

Therefore, it is necessary to reexamine this issue: (1) whether linear propagation generally outperforms non-linear propagation, and (2) whether a combination of linear and non-linear propagation can be applied to CF tasks to achieve better accuracy.

One of the main areas of application of controlled vocabularies is the domain of information retrieval systems, as they can be used to improve the findability of resources. For instance, concepts described in a vocabulary may be used to uniquely classify resources, to tag them with relevant keywords, or to annotate them with domain-specific attributes. The Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is an established data model of the Semantic Web domain that can be used to describe vocabularies in a semantically structured format. However, modelling a vocabulary is oftentimes highly time demanding, labor-intensive, and requires both familiarity with basic Semantic Web technologies and expertise in the application domain. This complicates both the development of new vocabularies and the conversion of existing vocabularies into the RDF data model. We propose an intermediate, YAML-based format to express concepts and their relationships hierarchically. The intermediate format can be converted automatically into a SKOS vocabulary using a command-line conversion program. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we selected 26 vocabularies of highly diverse formats, expressed them in the proposed intermediate format, which was subsequently converted in an automated manner into the corresponding SKOS vocabulary using our yaml2skos program.
